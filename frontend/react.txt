Frontend Development Guide for AI Assistant
Project Overview
* Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (Frontend), Vite, TypeScript, shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS with Supabase (Backend)
* Purpose: This guide establishes consistent standards for AI-assisted code generation
Coding Standards
JavaScript/React
* Use modern ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operators)
* Prefer functional components with React Hooks over class components
* Follow React's naming conventions:
    * Components: PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile)
    * Functions/variables: camelCase (e.g., getUserData)
    * Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_ITEMS)
* Keep components focused on a single responsibility
* Use named exports for components to improve debugging
* Implement proper error handling in async operations
CSS Approach
* Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
* Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes when not using modules
* Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
* Use CSS variables for theming (colors, spacing, typography)
Code Structure
* Organize files by feature rather than by type
* Include JSDoc comments for functions with non-obvious behavior
* Place related utilities in dedicated helper files
* Keep component files under 300 lines; refactor larger components
Supabase Integration
* Use Supabase JS client for all database operations
* Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data access
* Store environment variables securely (never commit API keys)
* Handle authentication consistently across components
Performance Considerations
* Optimize component re-renders (use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
* Implement code-splitting for larger application sections
* Lazy load components and assets when appropriate
* Minimize API calls and implement proper caching strategies
Testing & Documentation
* Include basic test cases for critical functionality
* Document API integrations and data models
* Add meaningful comments for complex logic sections
* Include prop-types or TypeScript interfaces for component props
